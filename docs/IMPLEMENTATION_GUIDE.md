# CogPrime Implementation Guide

This guide provides a structured approach and considerations for implementing the CogPrime architecture, as detailed in Dr. Ben Goertzel's paper, "[CogPrime: An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence](CogPrime_Integrative_Architecture_AGI.md)". (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`)

## 1. Overview of Implementation Approach

Implementing CogPrime is a significant undertaking, aiming to create a system capable of human-level Artificial General Intelligence. The approach should be:

*   **Iterative and Phased:** Start with foundational components and incrementally add complexity and cognitive functions.
*   **Modular yet Integrated:** Develop individual cognitive processes and memory systems as distinct modules, but with a strong emphasis on their deep integration and synergistic interaction (Cognitive Synergy).
*   **AtomSpace-Centric:** Leverage the OpenCog AtomSpace as the central knowledge representation and interaction hub for all cognitive components. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 5)
*   **Developmental:** Design the system with the capacity for learning and development through experience, potentially in simulated or robotic embodied environments. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 1.4, Claim 6)
*   **Focused on Emergence:** While components are engineered, the ultimate goal is the emergence of intelligent behavior from their complex interactions.

## 2. Core Components Needed

Based on the CogPrime architecture, the following core components are essential:

1.  **AtomSpace:** The central weighted, labeled hypergraph knowledge store. This is the foundation upon which all other components operate and interact. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 5.1)
    *   Handles various Atom types (ConceptNodes, LinkNodes, etc.)
    *   Supports TruthValues (for PLN) and AttentionValues (for ECAN).
    *   Facilitates Glocal Memory (local and distributed knowledge representation). (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 5.5)

2.  **Declarative Memory & Reasoning (PLN):**
    *   **Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN):** For uncertain inference, combining term logic, predicate logic, fuzzy truth values, and imprecise probabilities. Handles forward and backward chaining. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 6.1, Table 1)

3.  **Procedural Memory & Learning (MOSES):**
    *   **MOSES (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search):** For learning programs (procedures) through probabilistic evolutionary methods. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Table 1, Section 8.5.2)
    *   Procedure Repository: To store and manage learned programs.

4.  **Attentional Memory & Allocation (ECAN):**
    *   **Economic Attention Networks (ECAN):** To allocate system resources (ShortTermImportance - STI, LongTermImportance - LTI) to Atoms based on artificial economics principles, guiding focus and processing. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Table 1, Section 8.5.3)

5.  **Episodic Memory & Simulation:**
    *   **Internal Simulation Engine:** To store, replay, and learn from sequences of events (episodes) and to simulate potential future scenarios. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Table 1, Section 8.5.4)

6.  **Intentional Memory (Goal System):**
    *   Representation of goals (declaratively, e.g., as Atoms).
    *   Goal hierarchy management.
    *   Goal selection and prioritization driven by PLN (reasoning about goals) and ECAN (allocating attention to goals). (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Table 1, Section 8.5.6)
    *   Driven by "Cognitive Schematics": `Context -> Procedure -> Goal`. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 7)

7.  **Sensory Memory & Perception/Action Interface:**
    *   Interface to low-level sensorimotor processing systems (e.g., DeSTIN or similar hierarchical temporal memory systems). (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Table 1, Section 8.5.5)
    *   Mechanisms to convert raw sensory data into AtomSpace representations and execute motor commands.

8.  **Map Formation / Cognitive Equation Fulfillment:**
    *   Mechanisms for recognizing large-scale patterns within the AtomSpace and embodying them as new, localized knowledge items (Atoms). (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 8.6)

9.  **Agent Core / Cognitive Cycle:**
    *   The main loop that orchestrates the interaction of all cognitive processes, manages the flow of information, and drives the agent's behavior based on its goals and perceptions.

## 3. Development Roadmap

A possible phased development roadmap:

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Layer**
    *   Set up and configure the OpenCog AtomSpace.
    *   Develop a basic agent shell or main loop (cognitive cycle).
    *   Implement basic AttentionValue (STI/LTI) propagation (rudimentary ECAN).
    *   Define core Atom types for representing basic concepts, predicates, and goals.

*   **Phase 2: Core Cognitive Processes (Initial Versions)**
    *   Develop a functional subset of PLN: basic inference rules, truth value calculation and propagation.
    *   Develop a basic version of MOSES: program representation, simple evolutionary operations, fitness evaluation.
    *   Implement a more sophisticated ECAN for dynamic attention allocation.
    *   Establish the `Context -> Procedure -> Goal` schematic representation and basic handling.

*   **Phase 3: Memory Systems Integration**

    *   Develop an initial interface for a simulation engine.
    *   Begin work on interfaces for perception (inputting sensory data as Atoms) and action (executing simple procedures).

*   **Phase 4: Embodiment and Basic Interaction**
    *   Integrate with a simple virtual environment (e.g., a Minecraft-like world as described in CogPrime experiments) or a basic robotic platform. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 2.1)
    *   Enable the agent to perform simple tasks, learn from reinforcement, and basic imitation.

    *   Deepen the integration points between PLN, MOSES, ECAN, and other components to foster cognitive synergy.
    *   Implement map formation mechanisms.
    *   Focus on developmental learning: enabling the agent to acquire more complex skills and knowledge over time.
    *   Address scalability and efficiency of all components.
    *   Introduce more complex linguistic capabilities (e.g., using Link Grammar).

## 4. Integration Points Between Components

Cognitive synergy is key. Components must not operate in isolation. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 1.2, 8.8)

*   **AtomSpace:** The universal medium. All components read from and write to the AtomSpace.
    *   PLN reasons over Atoms.
    *   MOSES learns procedures (represented as Atoms or linked to Atoms) based on AtomSpace states and goals.
    *   ECAN assigns STI/LTI to all Atoms, influencing all other processes.
    *   Episodic memory stores sequences of AtomSpace states or events.
    *   Goals are Atoms, reasoned about by PLN, prioritized by ECAN.
*   **PLN and MOSES:**
    *   PLN can provide context or constraints for MOSES's search.
    *   MOSES-learned procedures can be translated into declarative knowledge for PLN. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 6.1)
*   **PLN and ECAN:**
    *   ECAN's attention values guide PLN's inference search (pruning).
    *   The results of PLN inference can update the importance of Atoms, influencing ECAN.
*   **PLN and Simulation/Episodic Memory:**
    *   Simulations provide data (episodes) for PLN to reason about.
    *   PLN can guide what simulations to run or what past episodes are relevant.
*   **MOSES and Simulation/Episodic Memory:**
    *   Simulations provide environments for MOSES to evaluate learned procedures.
    *   Past successful procedures (episodes of their use) can seed MOSES.
*   **ECAN and All Processes:** ECAN provides the attentional landscape, focusing computational resources.
*   **Goal System:**
    *   Goals (Atoms) are evaluated by PLN (e.g., feasibility, preconditions).
    *   ECAN allocates attention to active goals, influencing action selection.
    *   Procedures learned by MOSES are aimed at achieving goals.
*   **Perception/Action and Cognitive Core:**
    *   Perception provides Atoms representing the environment.
    *   The cognitive core (PLN, MOSES, Goal System) selects actions (procedures) to be executed by the action system.
*   **Cognitive Schematics (`Context -> Procedure -> Goal`):** This structure is a central integration pattern, with PLN evaluating the likelihood, MOSES learning the `Procedure`, and the Goal System managing the `Goal`. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 7)

## 6. Testing Approach

Testing an AGI system is complex and multifaceted. (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 9)

*   **Unit Tests:** For individual algorithms (e.g., a specific PLN rule, a MOSES operator, ECAN update function).
*   **Component Integration Tests:** Test interactions between pairs or small groups of components (e.g., PLN reasoning over knowledge asserted by the perception module; ECAN allocating attention based on goal updates).
*   **Scenario-Based Testing ("Competency Tasks"):**
    *   Design specific tasks that require multiple cognitive functions, inspired by human cognitive development or the examples in the CogPrime paper (e.g., simple problem solving, learning by imitation, basic language interaction). (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 9.1, Section 10)
    *   Example: "Build me something with blocks that I haven’t seen before." (Context: `CogPrime - An Integrative Architecture for Embodied Artificial General Intelligence.md`, Section 10)
*   **Developmental Testing:**
    *   Assess the system's ability to learn and improve over time with continued experience in an environment.
    *   Track the acquisition of new skills and knowledge.

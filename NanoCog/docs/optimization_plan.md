# NanoCog Cognitive Flowchart: Optimization & Evaluation Framework

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive optimization and evaluation strategy for NanoCog training that integrates neural-symbolic synergy principles with hypergraph-encoded cognitive patterns. The approach focuses on enhancing the model's ability to understand and generate Atomese/Scheme code while maintaining alignment with CogPrime's cognitive architecture principles.

## 1. Cognitive Landscape Mapping

### Current Training Pipeline Analysis

#### Data Preparation (`prepare.py`)
- **Current State**: Basic text concatenation with document separators
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive corpus including CogPrime theory and OpenCog implementation
- **Limitations**: Linear text processing without cognitive structure encoding

#### Training Configuration
- **Current State**: GitHub workflow-based configuration with CI/full modes
- **Strengths**: Parameterized training with different model sizes
- **Limitations**: No curriculum learning or adaptive sampling strategies

#### Introspection Infrastructure (`introspection/atomspace_client.py`)
- **Current State**: REST API client with bottleneck detection capabilities
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive cognitive state analysis, pattern mining, attention statistics
- **Limitations**: Limited integration with training loop and evaluation metrics

### Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Linear Data Processing**: Current prepare.py treats all data equally without cognitive hierarchy
2. **Static Training Strategy**: No curriculum learning or adaptive attention allocation
3. **Limited Evaluation Metrics**: Missing symbolic accuracy and emergent pattern detection
4. **Disconnected Introspection**: Analysis capabilities not integrated into training feedback loop

## 2. Optimization Pathways

### 2.1 Hypergraph-Structured Sample Integration

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Cognitive Schematic Encoding**: Embed Context→Procedure→Goal patterns as training samples
- **Attention Value Annotation**: Include STI/LTI metadata in training data
- **Atomese Pattern Templates**: Generate synthetic but valid Atomese structures

#### Sample Types to Add
```scheme
;; Cognitive Schematic Examples
(ImplicationLink (stv 0.85 0.92)
  (AndLink
    (StateLink (ConceptNode "Context") (ConceptNode "active"))
    (EvaluationLink (PredicateNode "condition") (ListLink ...)))
  (SequentialLink
    (ExecutionLink (SchemaNode "procedure1") (VariableNode "$X"))
    (ExecutionLink (SchemaNode "procedure2") (VariableNode "$X"))))

;; ECAN Attention Patterns
(AtomSpace
  (set-sti! (ConceptNode "important-concept") 0.8)
  (set-lti! (ConceptNode "memory-pattern") 0.6))
```

### 2.2 Curriculum Learning Implementation

### 2.4 Recursive Self-Introspection Tasks

#### Model Self-Evaluation Prompts
```

ATOMSPACE_DATA: {current attention distribution, active goals, schematics}
TASK: Identify potential bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.
EXPECTED_FORMAT: Structured analysis with actionable recommendations.
```

#### Feedback Integration
- Use model's self-analysis to adjust training emphasis
- Incorporate bottleneck predictions into curriculum weighting

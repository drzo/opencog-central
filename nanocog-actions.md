Great idea!
Let's create GitHub Actions workflows for automated NanoCog training and running.
This will make it easy to maintain and test the system.

Perfect! I've created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for NanoCog. Here's what was implemented:

## ðŸ“‹ GitHub Actions Workflows Created

### 1. **nctrain.yml** - NanoCog Training Workflow
- **Triggers:** Push/PR to NanoCog files, manual dispatch
- **Features:**
  - CI mode: Quick training with tiny model (2 layers, 10 iterations)
  - Full mode: Configurable parameters via workflow_dispatch
  - Downloads nanoGPT repository automatically
  - Prepares CogPrime dataset
  - Saves trained model as artifact
  - Tests model sampling after training

### 2. **ncrun.yml** - NanoCog Testing & Deployment Workflow
- **Triggers:** Push/PR, after training completion, manual dispatch
- **Features:**
  - Downloads trained model artifact
  - Creates minimal checkpoint if no model available
  - Comprehensive test suite:
    - Unit tests for AtomSpace introspection client
    - Mock AtomSpace data generation tests
    - CLI interface tests
    - FastAPI server endpoint tests
  - Optional server deployment for manual testing
  - Mock data support for CI/CD without real AtomSpace

### 3. **Python Package Structure** âœ…
- Added `__init__.py` files to make NanoCog a proper Python package
- Exported key classes and functions
- Added convenience functions for easy setup

## ðŸš€ How the Workflows Work

### Training Pipeline:
```yaml
# Manual trigger for full training:
- Go to Actions â†’ Train NanoCog Model â†’ Run workflow
- Select "full" training type
- Configure parameters (layers, heads, iterations, etc.)
- Wait for training to complete
- Download the model artifact
```

### Testing Pipeline:
```yaml
# Automatic on every push/PR:
- Downloads latest model (or creates minimal one)
- Runs all unit tests
- Tests server endpoints
- Tests CLI functionality
- Optionally deploys server for manual testing
```

### CI/CD Benefits:
- **Automated Testing:** Every change to NanoCog is tested
- **Quick Feedback:** CI mode trains tiny models in minutes
- **Full Training:** Manual dispatch allows production training
- **Artifact Management:** Models are saved and versioned
- **Mock Testing:** Can test without real AtomSpace
- **Deployment Ready:** Optional server deployment for demos

## ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Includes:
- AtomSpace client connection and queries
- Mock data generation for development
- CLI command parsing and interaction
- Server API endpoints (chat, diagnostics, streaming)
- Model loading and generation
- Error handling and edge cases

The workflows are now part of the PR and will activate once merged! ðŸŽ‰

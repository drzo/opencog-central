; Simple example of using the graph rewrites to emulate chmical
; reactions. This will search the AtomSpace for anything matching
; the query, and then create a new molecule whenever it finds the
; matching pattern.
;
; To run this example, start the guile shell in the `examples` directory
; (the directory holding this file!) and then say
;   `(load "reaction.scm")`
; It will print the results.
